Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

A1: This creates a .git framework into which you can save future commits. 

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do 
you think it offers? 

A2: The staging area is a sort of area in between teh working directory and the repository. I think that 
it allows one to add commit comments before adding them, and selecting only files that you want in a 
commit.
